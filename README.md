# Golinux

A foundational Go library (i.e. no `main()`) containing low level reusable universal linux functions, for managing any Linux platform. 

It provides a set of primitives that handle cross-distribution differences automatically. no need to know/worry if the linux host is `Rhel`, `debian`, `alpine`, `ubuntu`, ... .

This library offers a high-level API for common Linux administration tasks, uning the same universal primitive** including:

- `dnfapt`: A package for managing software packages on RHEL and Debian systems.
- `oservice`: A package for starting, stopping, and checking the status of OS services.
- `runCliLocal()`: A primitive to play any complex linux CLI on the local VM
- `runCliSsh()`: A primitive to play any complex linux CLI on a remote VM

# Howtos
## get code from repo
**purpose**
How to use code from another `go` project that is also in active development.
```shell
# in golinux/go.mod (need code form gocore)
require github.com/abtransitionit/gocore v0.0.0
replace github.com/abtransitionit/gocore => ../gocore
```
- then `go mod tidy`
